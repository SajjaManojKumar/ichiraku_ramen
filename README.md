# Ichiraku Ramen
The Ramen shop which is at your fingure tips.

We have specifically designed this website for small business owners and rush hour customers. 
Given small business owners may not find it easy to reach into new markets, new localities, or even new streets. They stick on to a street for longer period. The Ramen shop is one amongst those fast food resutrents where customers will have to sit and dine. Hence, it often involves a huge task of spending time waiting for their turn for customers during the rush hour. The possible resons for this problem may be, the shop/business is too small to accomidate many customers at once, or the Ramen may not be avalibel at your door step.

## SO HOW ARE WE HELPING THEM?

We have designed a website which has:
    -> minimal dependency on the database.
    -> stores common data which may not be use of intrest to be stollen.
    -> minimum knoldge required to make use of this website for the resturent owners and also customers. 

## WHAT ABOUT RUSH HOUR CUSTOMERS?
Humm, we knew the the rat race out there constently keeps moving, i.e., today you may be in Japan, tomorrow you can be in Silicon vally. Traditional food ordering website will need user to have an account in that system. This account maybe used for future ording in same website. But, many custoers may not find them selves in same place to order again. Imagine a tourist who vists a place, which he may not vist that place again in near future. This rises a demand of have a food ordering system which may not demand the user account, but also work as afficiently as other systems does. 
Well that is exactly what we designed here. In this website, you don't need an account to order Ramen. Moreover you can order anytime from anywhere.
